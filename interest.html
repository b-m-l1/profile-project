<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
<p>My interest in IT started in high school - Primarily through some work experience with a local manufacturing company. I didnâ€™t really follow it up originally, as I found my first full time job and focused on that. Thus, my experience in the area is a little bit sparse - I have some knowledge of taking things apart and putting them together, and some very basic knowledge of what parts are within a physical desktop.</p>
