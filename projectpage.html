<h1>Project Details</h1>
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>This project is an asset tracking software, intended for companies and groups to track basic availability and potential maintainance issues with vehicles and equipment through a database that can be customized per piece of equipment, through a database that can be customized per item, as well as display a pass/fail metric for if the equipment is being used, ready for use, or in need of attention.<br><br>Included fields in the project concept are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Availability - Vehicle/equipment up to date on maintenance and not in use</li>
<li>Maintainance Status - Track services, log sheets, vehicle check sheets, etc</li>
<li>Sign in/sign out dates and names for shared equipment</li>
<li>Ability to add forms or field on a per-client basis for customization to suit the needs of each item - Hour meters, odometers, etc.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>A problem that seems to be fairly common within fleets of equipment or vehicles is an inability to keep track of vehicle and equipment maintenance. Having a centralized and easy to access database would assist small business owners and franchise operators with asset management, ensuring their vehicles meet standards that they can set up within the product. For example, one could set up the database to ensure weekly vehicle checks and regular service requirements are being completed or met, along with knowing at a glance which vehicles are idle, which need tending to, and who was responsible for the vehicle last or currently.</p>
